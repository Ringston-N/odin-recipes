        <h2>Description</h2>
        Roast beef doesn't refer to just one cut of beef — eye of round, bottom round roast,
         top round roast, top sirloin roast, and bone-in rib roast are all commonly used cuts. 
         Affordable eye of round roast is the best pick for this recipe — its rich flavors 
         develop beautifully during slow cooking.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>3 pounds beef eye of round roast, at room temperature</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
        </ul></p>
    <p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Make sure roast is at room temperature. 
                Tie roast at 3-inch intervals with cotton twine;
                this helps it from drying out and allows it to cook more evenly. 
                Place roast on a rack in a baking pan.</li>
            <li>Mix together salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl. 
                Rub seasoning mixture into the meat.</li>
            <li>Place in the preheated oven and roast for 60 minutes, or 20 minutes per pound 
                if your roast is larger or smaller. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center 
                should read 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board.
                 Cover loosely with foil, and let rest so juices can redistribute, 
                 15 to 20 minutes</li>
                <li>Slice and serve</li>
             </ol> </p>
