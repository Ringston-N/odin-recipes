        <h2>Description</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
    Beef jerky is lean, trimmed beef that has been cut into strips and dried. 
    Drying (or dehydrating) meat with heat and salt slows bacterial growth dramatically, 
    stretching its lifespan by many months. 
    The word "jerky" comes from a Quechua word: "Ch'arki," which literally means 
    "dry, salted meat."
